## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@runway-detection.com] (replace with your actual email)
2. **Subject**: Use "Security Vulnerability Report - Runway Detection System"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if known)

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide:

- **Vulnerability Type**: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow, etc.
- **Component**: Which part of the system is affected
- **Severity**: Your assessment of the impact
- **Reproduction Steps**: Clear steps to demonstrate the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, dependencies

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours  
- **Fix Development**: Varies by complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using this system:

#### Input Validation
```python
# Always validate file paths
def validate_image_path(image_path):
    if not os.path.exists(image_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Image not found: {image_path}")
    
    # Check file extension
    valid_extensions = ['.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg']
    if not any(image_path.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in valid_extensions):
        raise ValueError("Invalid file extension")
```

#### Model Security
```python
# Verify model integrity
import hashlib

def verify_model_checksum(model_path, expected_hash):
    """Verify model file hasn't been tampered with"""
    with open(model_path, 'rb') as f:
        model_hash = hashlib.sha256(f.read()).hexdigest()
    
    if model_hash != expected_hash:
        raise SecurityError("Model checksum mismatch - possible tampering")
```

#### Data Privacy
- Never log sensitive image data
- Sanitize file paths before processing
- Use secure temporary directories
- Clean up temporary files after processing

### üîç Common Security Considerations

#### Path Traversal Prevention
```python
import os.path

def safe_path_join(base_path, user_path):
    """Safely join paths to prevent directory traversal"""
    # Normalize and resolve the path
    full_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(base_path, user_path))
    
    # Ensure the path is within the base directory
    if not full_path.startswith(os.path.abspath(base_path)):
        raise SecurityError("Path traversal detected")
    
    return full_path
```

#### Memory Safety
```python
# Clear sensitive data from memory
def secure_clear_array(arr):
    """Securely clear numpy array from memory"""
    if arr is not None:
        arr.fill(0)
        del arr
```

### üìä Dependency Security

We regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### üîê Model Security

#### Model Validation
- Verify model checksums before loading
- Use only trusted model sources
- Validate model outputs for reasonable ranges

#### Inference Security  
- Limit input image sizes to prevent memory exhaustion
- Set timeouts for inference operations
- Validate input data formats

### üö® Security Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify relevant parties

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze the scope of impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Develop mitigation strategy

3. **Recovery**:
   - Apply security patches
   - Restore systems safely
   - Monitor for recurring issues

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security measures
   - Communicate resolution

### üìù Security Checklist

For developers and users:

- [ ] Use latest supported version
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Use secure file handling
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Log security events appropriately
- [ ] Regular security scanning
- [ ] Follow principle of least privilege
